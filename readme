The directory containing this file should include a C++ source code file "dijkstra.cpp".
The source code contains a C++ implementation of Dijkstra's Shortest Path along with two modifications A*, and A* with landmarks.
It can be compiled using the command "g++ dijkstra.cpp".

The resulting executable requires only an input file called "graph1000.txt" and will output five new files.
"output_graph.txt" is only used to verify that a graph has been properly read and can be ignored.

Each shortest path algorithm will output to a corresponding file "output_<algorithm_name>.txt" of which there should be three.
They can be used to view the number of nodes visited and the total cost of the path through those nodes for each time the algorithm was run.

The final file to consider is "output_comparison.txt".
This file contains the average path lengths resulting from all the runs of the algorithms.
The relative efficiency of each algorithm can easily be seen by the difference between the path length averages.
Lower values indicate greater savings on nodes visited.

The directory with this readme may already contain an executable and outputs from a sample run.
They can be safely removed or overwritten.
